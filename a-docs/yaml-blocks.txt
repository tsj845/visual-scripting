each yaml document defines one block's appearence

---
throws : true # this block can raise errors, omit it if block doesn't raise errors

# each block will have two names unless they are the same
name : common name
# when names differ
name:
    programmer : clear and concise
    basic : a bit more verbose

description : describes what this block does

# describes a general area that the block is in ex: "add" is in the "math" category
category : mycategory

# use 0 for blocks which won't encounter race conditions ex: adding 1 + 2 always results in 3 regardless of outside states
# use 1 to terminate control flow
# use 2 or more to create a block that can switch which control flow path is run after it executes
# blocks never have more than one control flow input, but can have an arbitrary number of control flow outputs
controlflows : 0, 1, 2, ... n

# inputs the block has
inputs:
    some_input : data_type
    different_input : optional_data?=some_default_value
    # the "__HIDDEN" name is just my personal convention, could be anything
    __HIDDEN : "![*,>_TEXT]string"

# the outputs that the block has
outputs:
    myoutput : bool

# the id of the operation to run
opid : process.terminate
...

see "yaml-blocks-input" for more details on the "__HIDDEN" input of the above example
